# BoltAPI

BoltAPI is a python wrapper class around the public Bolt IoT API. (https://www.boltiot.com/)

This is not even alpha qualitity code, only produced so I could do some testing. Don't use it for anything you actually care about, no seriously, don't. However if you want to submit pull requests, go for it.
